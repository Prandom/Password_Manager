# Password_Manager
This is version 1 of a password manager created in C++. 
This includes options through which one can view the entire database, add new data of a site or remove a site from the existing database. 
The database is stored in "User.txt" file.
The passwords stored in the file are encrypted. (Though better encryption is desired)
